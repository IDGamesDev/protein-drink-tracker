Walkthrough - Protein Food List Feature
I have added a new page to your Protein Drink Tracker that displays the top natural protein foods in a chart.

Changes
New Page: Created 
protein-food.html
 which contains a vertical bar graph using Chart.js.
New Button: Added a "List of Protein Food (Natural)" button to 
index.html
.
Styles: Updated 
styles.css
 to include styles for the new button, matching your existing theme.
Verification Steps
Since I was unable to verify this automatically due to a browser environment issue, please follow these steps:

Open 
index.html
 in your web browser.
Scroll down to find the new button labeled "List of Protein Food (Natural)".
Click the button.
Verify that it opens a new page showing a chart with protein foods (Soybeans, Chicken Breast, etc.).
Check that the design matches your dark theme (or light theme if you toggle it).
Click the "← Back to Tracker" button to return to the main page.
